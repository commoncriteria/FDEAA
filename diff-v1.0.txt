This chapter describes the security requirements which have to be		      <
fulfilled by the [OS](#abbr_OS){.abbr}. Those requirements comprise		      <
functional components from Part 2 and assurance components from Part 3		      <
of [\[\]](#bibCC). The following notations are used:				      <
										      <
-   **Refinement** operation (denoted by **bold text**): is used to add		      <
    details to a requirement, and thus further restricts a requirement.		      <
-   **Selection** (denoted by *italicized text*): is used to select one		      <
    or more options provided by the \[[CC](#abbr_CC)\] in stating a		      <
    requirement.								      <
-   **Assignment** operation (denoted by [italicized				      <
    text]{.assignable-content}): is used to assign a specific value to		      <
    an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Showing		      <
    the value in square brackets indicates assignment.				      <
-   **Iteration** operation: are identified with a number inside		      <
    parentheses (e.g. \"(1)\")							      <

Appendix D - Entropy Documentation and Assessment {#entropyappendix .indexable data-l <
=================================================				      <
										      <
This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the		      <
entropy source used by the [OS](#abbr_OS).\					      <
The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that,		      <
after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy		      <
source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This	      <
documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design			      <
description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health		      <
testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the			      <
[TSS](#abbr_TSS).								      <
										      <
D.1 Design Description {#entropydesign .indexable data-level="2"}		      <
----------------------								      <
										      <
Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole,	      <
including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any			      <
information that can be shared regarding the design should also be		      <
included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the		      <
product.\									      <
The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to		      <
include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be		      <
obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The		      <
documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating		      <
where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next,		      <
any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, [XOR](#abbr_XOR), etc.),		      <
if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy		      <
source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should		      <
also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples		      <
are encouraged.\								      <
This design must also include a description of the content of the		      <
security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the		      <
security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot		      <
affect the entropy rate.\							      <
If implemented, the design description shall include a description of		      <
how third-party applications can add entropy to the [RBG](#abbr_RBG). A		      <
description of any [RBG](#abbr_RBG) state saving between power-off and		      <
power-on shall be included.							      <
										      <
D.2 Entropy Justification {#entropyjustification .indexable data-level="2"}	      <
-------------------------							      <
										      <
There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in		      <
the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source		      <
delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the [RBG](#abbr_RBG)		      <
output (by this particular [OS](#abbr_OS)). This argument will include a	      <
description of the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy		      <
(in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient		      <
entropy is going into the [OS](#abbr_OS) randomizer seeding process.		      <
This discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy		      <
source can be relied upon to produce bits with entropy.\			      <
The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy		      <
rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.\		      <
For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the			      <
min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits		      <
will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the			      <
min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no		      <
particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected		      <
that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of		      <
min-entropy in each output.\							      <
For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the [OS](#abbr_OS)		      <
vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the		      <
source, the documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of		      <
min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It is acceptable for		      <
the vendor to "assume" an amount of min-entropy, however, this			      <
assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In		      <
particular, the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the			      <
assumption included in the [ST](#abbr_ST).\					      <
Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also		      <
include how the [DRBG](#abbr_DRBG) is initialized with the entropy		      <
stated in the [ST](#abbr_ST), for example by verifying that the			      <
min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed	      <
the [DRBG](#abbr_DRBG) or that the rate of entropy expected based on the	      <
amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the			      <
statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the			      <
[DRBG](#abbr_DRBG) is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly	      <
related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.\	      <
The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any		      <
third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.		      <
										      <
D.3 Operating Conditions {#entropyoperatingconditions .indexable data-level="2"}      <
------------------------							      <
										      <
The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control of		      <
the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency, temperature,	      <
and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may		      <
affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will		      <
also include the range of operating conditions under which the entropy		      <
source is expected to generate random data. It will clearly describe the	      <
measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the entropy	      <
source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly,			      <
documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy		      <
source is known to malfunction or become inconsistent. Methods used to		      <
detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included.			      <
										      <
D.4 Health Testing {#entropyhealthtesting .indexable data-level="2"}		      <
------------------								      <
										      <
More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale		      <
will be documented. This includes a description of the health tests, the	      <
rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at		      <
start, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health	      <
test, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be			      <
appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.		      <
