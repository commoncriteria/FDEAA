    <section title="PP Overview" id="sec-ppoverview">
        <h:p>
		The purpose of the first set of Collaborative Protection Profiles (cPPs) for Full Drive Encryption (FDE): Authorization Acquisition (AA) and Encryption Engine (EE) is to provide requirements for Data-at-Rest protection for a lost device that contains storage. These cPPs allow FDE solutions based in software and/or hardware to meet the requirements. The form factor for a storage device may vary, but could include: system hard drives/solid state drives in servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices, tablets, and external media. A hardware solution could be a Self-Encrypting Drive or other hardware-based solutions; the interface (USB, SATA, etc.) used to connect the storage device to the host machine is outside the scope of this cPP.
        </h:p><h:p>
        Full Drive Encryption encrypts all data (with certain exceptions) on the storage device and permits access to the data only after successful authorization to the FDE solution. The exceptions include the necessity to leave a portion of the storage device (the size may vary based on implementation) unencrypted for such things as the Master Boot Record (MBR) or other AA/EE pre-authentication software. These FDE cPPs interpret the term “full drive encryption” to allow FDE solutions to leave a portion of the storage device unencrypted so long as it contains plaintext user or plaintext authorization data.
        </h:p><h:p>
        Since the FDE cPPs support a variety of solutions, two cPPs describe the requirements for the FDE components shown in Figure 1.  
        </h:p>
        
        <h:p><figure entity="images/fde-components.png" title="FDE Components" id="toe"/></h:p>

        <h:p>The FDE cPP - Authorization Acquisition describes the requirements for the Authorization Acquisition piece and details the security requirements and assurance activities necessary to interact with a user and result in the availability of sending a Border Encryption Value (BEV)to the Encryption Engine.</h:p>
        <h:p>The FDE cPP - Encryption Engine describes the requirements for the Encryption Engine piece and details the necessary security requirements and assurance activities for the actual encryption/decryption of the data by the DEK. Each cPP will also have a set of core requirements for management functions, proper handling of cryptographic keys, updates performed in a trusted manner, audit and self-tests. </h:p>
        <h:p>This TOE description defines the scope and functionality of the Authorization Acquisition, and
            the Security Problem Definition describes the assumptions made about the operating
            environment and the threats to the AA that the cPP requirements address</h:p>
